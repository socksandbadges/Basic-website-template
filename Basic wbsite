<!-- Something to think about:
Use colour to your advantage
Red-attracts the eye BUT using a bold red for a backround colour can look tacky
Green-restful 
Blue-the most used office colour
Yellow-happy colour but again a bold yellow for bakround often doesn't look good
Black-an authority colour but make sure you dont have your text as black aswell
Grey-consevitive 
White-purity but often looks a bit boring
afab people often prefer blue purble and green
and amab people often prefer blue green and black

also make sure the text you chose is legible curcive is often hard to read
and make sure your text and backround colours don't clash
